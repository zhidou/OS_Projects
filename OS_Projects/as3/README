Contribution: FIFO with stack and FIFO with interrupt

1.	FIFO-1 is FIFO system with stack but without using interrupt
	FIFO-2 is the system enable interrupt

2.	Run this code through qemu
	qemu-system-i386 -kernel FIFO-x (x could be 1, 2)
	check the result
	qemu-vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5900
	
3.	The default schedule method is FIFO, and we set another schedule method
	in our code, shortest remaining time first. If you want to change to this
	method, change the define value of FIFO to 0, SRT to 1 in init.c for FIFO-1
	and in type.h for FIFO-2.

4.	For good effect in demo, we add disable interrupt and enable interrupt at the
	beginning and ending place of thread function code, to guarantee it could print
	one by one, instead of just showing the final result instantaneously. But we know
	in real life we do not have to do that.
