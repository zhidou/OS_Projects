1. we create a MemOS, which I put it in the boot menu list and then
	the grub could recognize it and boot it.
2. This MemOS is created by boot.s and init.c
3. In boot.s we set the multiboot flag and set a stack and all the related things
4. Then actually we print words on the screen by call init.c
5. In init.c actually what I should do is to fill the VGA buffer with the 
	things I want to show
6. Finally, we get back to boot.s
7. The linker file is use to link the file and I set the base space 
	is 0x100000, which just from 1M. Because below 1M there some
	unusable memory, but above from 0x00100000 - 0x00F00000 is free to use
8. after linked, we get MemOS, and put it in the boot file of virtual
	disk and add it in the list
